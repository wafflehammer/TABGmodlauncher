The TABG Mod Launcher automatically pulls the latest .dll files from https://github.com/Audixas/TabgGunGame.

1. Download latest mod launcher from https://github.com/Audixas/TABGmodlauncher/releases.
2. Run it (allow it to run if Windows blocks it, it's because Windows doesn't recognize it).
3. Confirm your install directory if asked (should automatically detect if it's in C:\ drive).
4. Select Modded to and hit Launch Game to automatically launch the game with the mod installed.
5. Make sure it's set to Modded in the server select, otherwise you'll get banned.
6. Click Ready and then Brawl to play the gun game mode.
7. The game will now always be modded, so you don't have to use the launcher. You only need to use the launcher if you need to update the mod or return the game to original.
